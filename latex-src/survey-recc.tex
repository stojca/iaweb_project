\section{Recommendation}

Responsive tables must be able to efficiently and effectively display data. It is only through a combination of good table design and responsive techniques one is able to achieve this. 

For good table design, it is imperative that you include Alternate Row Highlighting. This is a very simple technique that works on every browser and is not only helpful to the user but to the developer as it adds positively to the aesthetics. 

For a ``Jack of all trades'' approach, we suggest the following responsive techniques: Long Two Column, and Fixed Header. You are able to apply this for the 3 main screen sizes: PC, tablet, and phone. Being able to apply Long Two Column to phone-sized screens (or tablets in vertical mode) and leave Fixed Header on the remaining two sizes (PC and tablets in horizontal mode) automatically eliminates one of the 3 sizes you have to take care of. 

Another thing to keep in mind is to attach the vertical scrollable feature of Fixed Header to the Long Two Column. This ensures that the space the table is taking up is exactly the one allocated to it. It goes without saying that if the table is too wide (horizontally), it should be horizontally scrollable.

The figure below shows these techniques working together.

As you scroll through the table, notice the Fixed Header Technique in the image below.

For small-sized screens, the technique that would ``kick in'' is shown in the image below. Notice the `creeping' second `minitable' in the bottom part.
